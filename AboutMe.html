    <p>Welcome to <i>almost</i> everything about me!</p>
    <p>I grew up in Lake City, it's a sub city in Seattle. And the majority of my life, I've grown up in the same house. for about 14 years.
      For the first few weeks after my birth, I was in an incubater. I weighed about four pounds ish at 8 months. Apparently my length or size
      was from my knucles to my elbow. Apparently! So i've always been small. I am the first born in the United States and have been the 
      the highlight of my family's life for the majority of my life. When I was two years, two months and a couple of days old, my sister 
      was born and then she and I have always been close.
